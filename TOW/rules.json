A concealing unit may release one or more of its Fanatics during any Start of Turn sub-phase.\n\nWhen a Fanatic is released, it travels through the air to land spinning several feet away from its concealing unit, before embarking upon its erratic journey across the battlefield. To represent this, place the model so that its base is within 3\" of its concealing unit and not touching the bases of any other models.\n\n**Fanatic Movement:** During the Compulsory Moves sub-phase of the turn in which it was released, a Fanatic moves 2D6\" in a direction chosen by its controlling player.\n\nDuring each and every other Compulsory Moves sub-phase, a Fanatic Moves 2D6\" in a random direction. If a Fanatic’s movement brings it into contact with a unit (friend or foe), it moves through that unit. Continue to move it in the same direction until it can be placed on the battlefield with its base not touching the bases of any other models.\n\n*Note that, unlike other models, Fanatics ignore the 1\" rule.*\n\n**Moving Through a Fanatic:** Although dangerous, any unit may move through a Fanatic. Should a unit ever end its move ‘on top’ of a Fanatic, move the Fanatic by the shortest route possible until it can be placed on the battlefield with its base not touching the bases of any models.\n\n**Fanatic Ball & Chain:** Any unit (friend or foe) that is moved through by a moving Fanatic, or that moves through a Fanatic, suffers D6 Strength 5 hits, each with an AP of -3.\n\n**Death of a Fanatic:** A Fanatic model cannot be charged, targeted or attacked in any way.\nHowever, the life of a Fanatic is no less dangerous for this. Should a Fanatic find itself lying fully or partially underneath a template (one placed over a nearby unit, for example, or that has scattered), it risks being hit as normal. Additionally, if any natural double is rolled for its movement, or if a Fanatic moves into any difficult, dangerous or impassable terrain, or any type of linear obstacle, it comes to a sudden and terminal stop, and is immediately removed from play as a casualty.

In such campaigns, each individual game represents but one battle fought in an ongoing war and there are plenty of excuses to enjoy challenging and varied games.\n Many stories of the Warhammer world are told through campaign books, supplements and other publications which present exciting tales of epic deeds. Such publications present rules for recreating famous battles of history, translating them from the page to the tabletop.\n Often, campaigns are about conquering lands, with each player controlling multiple armies of the same faction, located in different regions. Each rival faction attempts to build its own dominion, increasing the size and strength of its armies and holdings. Such campaigns quickly turn bloody, as armies march forth to invade the lands of their neighbours.\n As victorious armies seize land, the defeated forces must retreat, regroup and rebuild their strength. This adds new strategic and tactical challenges as a player attempts to outmanoeuvre and outmatch their foes on the campaign map as well as the battlefield.\n Campaigns can be complex, involving many battles over many months and including rules for lines of supply, sieges, allies and spies, perhaps even random events such as plagues or rampaging monsters. Alternatively, a campaign can be quite a simple affair, with only a few parameters influencing the scenarios used in a small number of linked games.\n\n\nRelated:\nCampaign Trees\nLeague Campaigns\nScoring\nTaking It Further"

It is to be expected that unusual situations will arise when units get in one another's way, interfering with movement, shooting, combat and so forth.\n To deal with this, we encourage players to resolve uncertainties in a way that keeps the game flowing, or to seek the opinion of an impartial third party (at an organised event, where such situations can take on greater significance, this is the role of the event organiser or the umpires, and players should always defer to the ruling of such an official, as is right and honourable – only the most dastardly rapscallion would argue with such an exemplar of the hobby).\n For example, if moving fleeing, overrunning or pursuing units becomes too complex, with units blocking the movement of one another, you may decide to nudge one unit aside (by the smallest amount possible) to make space for another, or you may decide to go back and resolve the movement of certain units in a different order.\n If such resolution is impossible, the simplest solution is to rule that the unit cannot do the thing, by which we mean it cannot make the move, cannot take the shot, and so forth.

The important thing to remember with common magic items is that the rules given represent something that might appear in any army – something with a quite common magical effect, but an appearance unique to the race that created it.\n For example, in the hands of a General of the Empire, it would make sense for a 'Sword of Striking' to resemble a fine rapier, but when wielded by an Orc Warboss that same rapier would look out of place. It is perfectly acceptable for the model of an Orc Warboss equipped with a Sword of Striking to carry a large and brutal cleaver instead. What matters is that the points have been paid to include the item in your army, and that a suitable weapon is wielded by the model so that your opponent can easily remember what it represents.\n\n\nRelated: Using Magic Items"

At its most simple, players will often ignore percentages and other restrictions when creating their armies, choosing instead to write a muster list that best fits the narrative. Taking it further, some players will ignore points values altogether, and instead field opposing armies created purely to fit into their story.\n Of course, ignoring such rules can lead to an imbalanced match-up, and this thought may be unappealing to some players. This is perfectly acceptable and any group of players is encouraged to use the suggestions given here, or not, as they see fit. However, these imbalances can often prove part of the charm of a narrative battle, and can invariably be countered by special rules and objectives. Ignoring points values might lead to an army being outnumbered ten to one, for example, and that army might reasonably be expected to suffer a crushing defeat and terrible losses. But the challenge of the game might be to hold out until turn four – perhaps that will grant a vital messenger sufficient time to escape, carrying word of the size of the invading army, and thus the terrible defeat can be claimed as a victory (of sorts)."

To represent this, the players should write two muster lists (one for the attacker and one for the defender) as follows:\n # The Attacker\n The attacker should write a single 2,500 point muster list using the Orc & Goblin Tribes Grand Army composition list found in  Ravening Hordes . The General of this army must be an Orc Warboss or an Orc Bigboss mounted on a War Boar.\n # The Defender\n The defender should write a single 2,500 point muster list using the Mortuary Cult Army of Infamy composition list. The General of this army must be a High Priest who is a Level 4 Wizard, representing High Priest Ashurtak.\n Alternatively, this scenario may be played with any two armies of the players' choosing.\n # Set-Up\n  Place terrain  as described. As this battle is taking place in the rugged terrain of the Badlands, we advise keeping the terrain fairly sparse save for a few rocky outcroppings, some patches of raised ground and scattered clusters of coarse brush. There should also be a road near to the western board edge that runs the length of the board from north to south to represent the Zandri Road.\n # Deployment\n If this battle is being fought as a historical recreation, the Tomb Kings player is the defender and the Orc player is the attacker. Otherwise, the players must decide who is the attacker and who is the defender.\n The defender deploys their entire army within the defender's deployment zone, as shown on the map opposite. Once complete, the attacker deploys their entire army within the attacker's deployment zone with the exception of the Warboss, who is deployed in the centre of his army, as shown on the deployment map.\n  # First Turn\n In this scenario, the attacker will automatically take the first turn.\n # Game Length\n The battle will last for six rounds or until one side concedes.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner, as described in  the Warhammer: the Old World  rulebook. In addition:\n Should the Orc Warboss be slain, place a marker where he fell to represent the Warboss' body. At the end of the game, whichever force has the highest total  Unit Strength  within 6\" of the marker (not counting fleeing models) wins a bonus 200 Victory Points.\n Should High Priest Ashurtak be slain, place a marker where he fell to represent the Liche Priest's body.

The armies used in this scenario will be used again in the second and third scenarios.\n However, in the second game, both players will have to endure losses suffered in the first, meaning that their armies might be considerably smaller, and that one player might have a significant advantage if their losses are fewer. In the third game, one player is almost certain to be dramatically outnumbered as they make a desperate last stand in defence of the dark monolith.\n That being the case, this first scenario is ideal for armies of between 2,000 and 3,000 points, ensuring that they can withstand a degree of attrition.\n Players can use any army they wish and may even both field armies of the same type drawn from the same army list. The rival forces, determined in their quest, will view any other force as an enemy and be convinced that its goals are contrary to their own, thus setting the stage for some vicious battles!\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described.\n # Deployment\n Once terrain has been placed, the battlefield is divided into six equally sized zones, as shown on the map opposite.\n The loser of a roll-off deploys first, placing a single, noncharacter unit so that it is completely within one of the zones. The winner of the roll-off then deploys a single, non-character unit so that it is completely within one of the remaining, unoccupied zones. The players continue to alternate in this fashion until each has deployed three non-character units and there is a single unit within each zone.\n Following the same sequence, each player may then deploy a single character with one of their deployed units. All remaining units and characters are held in reserve (as follows).\n  # First Turn\n Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.\n # Game Length\n The battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n Surprise Battle:  Due to the surprise of encountering an unexpected enemy, any unit that wishes to declare a charge during the first round must first pass a Leadership test. If this test is failed, the unit does not count as having declared a charge.\n Reserves: Reserves are not deployed at the start of the battle. Instead they can enter play during the Compulsory Moves sub-phase of any turn – including the first – of their controlling player's choosing. When they arrive, reserves will enter the battlefield from any point on the battlefield edge that is completely within one of the zones (chosen at random) in which their controlling player deployed a unit at the start of the battle. Roll a D3 to randomly determine which of the three zones reserves arrive within.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner."

It is also possible (even encouraged) to combine these ideas in different ways:\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|D6|Result|\n|1|Riverbank: One side of the battlefield (short or long) can be treated as impassable terrain, representing the fast flowing waters. Perhaps two adjacent edges could be impassable terrain, representing the battle taking place where the river bends. Such a battlefield might feature areas of difficult or dangerous terrain, representing the muddy banks.|\n|2|Forest Glade:  The battlefield might be ringed around its edge with woods. The dense wood might cause reserves to get lost in the forest and arrive at randomly determined locations. The same may be true of units that pursue the enemy off the battlefield – they may become lost and not return immediately, if at all.|\n|3|Mountain Fastness:  The battlefield should be long and narrow, and at least two of its edges treated as impassable terrain. The rest of the battlefield might be populated with difficult and dangerous terrain in the form of rocky ground. If the ground is steep, the entire battlefield could count as sloping away from one edge, giving an advantage to the side that controls it.|\n|4|Underground Cavern:  An underground battle might be a tense and claustrophobic affair fought on a smaller than average battlefield with one or two points of access. Flying creatures are unlikely to be of much use, and war machines of certain types might prove ineffective. In fact, in the dark all missile weapons might be of limited use.|\n|5|Marshland: The majority of the battlefield can be treated as difficult terrain, with the only areas of open ground being low hills that rise from the mire. Cavalry and monsters may find such a battlefield especially difficult. Banks of mist might drift through the air, obscuring line of sight before dispersing, making units unsure where exactly the enemy is.|\n|6|Desert Dunes:  A desert battlefield need not be sparse. Hills can represent the shifting dunes; rock formations and ruins can dot the landscape. The heat might sap the strength of heavily armoured units, slowing them down. The glare of the sun might interfere with shooting, whilst unexpected winds and sandstorms can halt all movement and drive away flying creatures.|\n\n \n \n\n\nRelated: Forging a Narrative"

When combined with the location, you are able to say almost everything that needs to be said about the story behind the battle. All that remains is to learn the composition of the armies and the outcome – and these are things best revealed by playing the game.\n Using the suggestions given here and combining them with the Narrative Locations table, you can create a scenario that gives a battle a true sense of significance:\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|D6|Result|\n|1|Border Dispute:  Disagreements over the exact location of a border are common and they can be sparked by almost anything. Such disputes can quickly lead to bloodshed; their outcome can see borders move and cause tremendous upheaval. On the tabletop, a border dispute can be represented very simply with one army trying to drive its rival off and claim victory.|\n|2|Lost Riches:  The world contains many tremendous riches, and sometimes new wealth is discovered or lost wealth unearthed. In game terms, this could be represented by placing several objectives around the battlefield, each representing a cache of buried riches or a natural deposit of precious stones or metals. The winning player would be the one whose army controls the most objectives at the battle’s end.|\n|3|Nowhere to Run:  Tales of desperate last stands by beleaguered armies are the stuff of legend. On the tabletop, an army might be unable to retreat, forced to deploy on the banks of a mighty river or against an impassable cliff face, where it must fight to the death. Alternatively, an army might deploy in the centre of the battlefield, surrounded by its enemy.|\n|4|Access Rights:  Many battles have been fought for control of a stretch of road or river, a bridge or a ford, and many armies have found themselves ambushed en route to their destination. In a game, this might be represented by deploying one army in a narrow column that stretches across the table, with the enemy deployed to either side.|\n|5|Conquer New Lands:  As armies are defeated, their lands are left undefended, presenting vulnerable targets for rivals. Such contests for the control of land can be represented by dividing the battlefield into four quarters, each of which can be controlled by the side that has the most units completely within it. At the end of the battle, the side that controls the most quarters is victorious.|\n|6|Property Damage:  Treasured monuments, important buildings and sacred sites all present valuable targets for an enemy bent upon destruction. On the tabletop, this can be represented by placing a special feature at the centre of the battlefield which the armies fight to control. Alternatively, a special feature can be placed in a well-defended position, with one army attempting to wrest control of the feature from the enemy.|\n\n \n \n\n\nRelated: Forging a Narrative"

    "Name": "Second Linked Battle",
    "Type": "General",
    "Description": "Description: Although this scenario is designed to be the second of three linked battles, it can be played alone.\n # Army Selection\n If playing this game as the second of three linked battles, the players must use the same muster lists they used in the first. However, they must roll a D6 for each unit that suffered casualties or was removed from play during the first battle:\n Units that Suffered Casualties:  For each unit that lost more than a quarter (25%) of its Unit Strength during the first battle, roll a D6:\n - On a roll of 1-3, remove:\n - D3 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 5) if the unit's Unit Strength is 19 or lower.\n - D6 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 10) if the unit's Unit Strength is 20 or higher.\n - On a roll of 4+, the unit has managed to patch up its wounded and return them to battle. The unit may be fielded at full strength but must reduce its Leadership characteristic by 1.\n\n Destroyed Units:  For each unit that was removed from play for any reason (such as being destroyed in combat, being run down by an enemy unit whilst fleeing or fleeing off the battlefield) during the first battle, roll a D6:\n - On a roll of 1-2, the surviving members of the unit have scattered to the hills and not yet returned. The unit cannot be fielded in this game.\n - On a roll of 3+, the surviving members of the unit have regrouped. The unit may be fielded, but the number of models it contains is halved (rounding up to the nearest model).\n\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described. In addition, place a single large hill (ideally more than 12\" at its widest point) in the centre of the battlefield. Atop this hill, place either an  arcane monolith  or a  monument of glory  special feature.\n # Deployment\n Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the  alternating units  method.\n  # First Turn\n Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.\n # Game Length\n The battle will last a random number of rounds or until one side concedes. Starting at the end of the fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least one more round.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n Other than the army selection rules already given, this scenario has no special rules.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner. The player that controls the special feature at the end of the battle wins a bonus of 200 Victory Points (in addition to any bonus controlling the special feature may normally give).\n\n\nRelated: The Dark Monolith"

    "Description": "Description: # Historical Recreation\n The Battle of Matorea was fought between an army of Bretonnian Exiles led by Sir Cecil Gastonne, the Wyrm Slayer, and the undying legions of the Tomb Kings of Khemri, commanded by Settra the Imperishable himself. To represent this, the players should write three muster lists (one for the attacker and two for the defender) as follows:\n *The Attacker*\n The attacker should write a single 3,000 points muster list using the Tomb Kings of Khemri Grand Army composition list found in  Warhammer: the Old World – Ravening Hordes .\n *The Defender*\n The defender should write two muster lists, one representing their main force, the other representing the rescue force:\n - Main Force:  The defender should write a 1,750 points muster list using the  Bretonnian Exiles  Army of Infamy composition list. The General of this army must be Sir Cecil Gastonne, the Wyrm Slayer.\n - The Rescue Force:  The defender should write a 1,250 points muster list using the  Errantry Crusade  Army of Infamy composition list, with the following exceptions:\n - The General of the rescue force must be a Bretonnian Duke mounted on a Royal Pegasus, representing the Duke of Brionne.\n - The rescue force must include Lady Élisse Duchaard.\n\n Alternatively, this scenario may be played with any two armies of the players' choosing, in which case the defender must spend between 25% and 33% of their army's points value on an allied contingent to act as the rescue force.\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described. In addition, place a defensible position as shown on the map.\n Defensible Position:  A defensible position is a hill measuring up to 16\" at its widest point, featuring a single rock-strewn slope. A rock-strewn slope may be no more than 8\" wide and counts as dangerous terrain. Atop the hill is a flat area measuring no more than 8\" along its longest side. One edge of this flat area must be bordered by staked defences, as described below.\n # Deployment\n The defender deploys their main force within the defender's deployment zone, as shown on the map. Once complete, the attacker deploys their entire army within the attacker's deployment zone.\n  # First Turn\n In this scenario, the attacker will automatically take the first turn.\n # Game Length\n The battle will last for six rounds or until one side concedes.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n Reinforcements: The defender's rescue force gains the Ambushers special rule. However, from the beginning of round two onwards, the defender rolls a single D6 for their entire rescue force during each of their  Start of Turn  sub-phases (rather than rolling a D6 for each individual unit). Upon its arrival, the entire rescue force enters the battle as reinforcements from the western board edge. In other words, all units within the rescue force must be placed on the edge of the battlefield to the right of the defender's deployment zone. Any units belonging to the rescue force that cannot be placed on the battlefield during the turn it arrives may be left in reserve and can be brought on as described previously during the following turn.\n Fresh from victory at the Citadel Bouelia, all units in the reserve force benefit from the Blessings of the Lady special rule without having to pray at the start of the game.\n Staked Defences:  Staked defences count as a low linear obstacle. However, unless it has the Fly (X) special rule, any unit that charges an enemy behind staked defences makes a disordered charge and becomes Disrupted. In addition, any model whose troop type is 'cavalry' or 'chariot' must make a Peril test (as if it had fled through an enemy unit) if it ends its charge move in base contact with staked defences.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner, as described in  the Warhammer: the Old World  rulebook. In addition, at the end of the game:\n - The defending player wins a bonus 250 Victory Points if there are no models belonging to the attacking player upon the flat area atop the defensible position.\n - The attacking player wins a bonus 250 Victory Points if they are the only player with models upon the flat area atop the defensible position."

In the first, two rival forces encounter one another unexpectedly whilst searching for the same monument to darkness. In the second, they battle once more for control of the monolith, each enduring the losses inflicted during the previous encounter. In the final scenario, the force that holds the monolith must fight bitterly to defend its prize against enemy reinforcements.\n This is a simple premise, and much of the detail is left blank, leaving players to decide upon the armies that take part and upon the end goals of each player. Is the goal to destroy the monolith, or to use it for evil? Where do the battles take place? Deep within the Forest of Shadows, or upon the frozen steppes of Kislev? How large are the armies? Are they small patrols roaming the wilderness, or mighty war hosts gathered by powerful lords? These are questions for the players to answer. How they do so is part of the fun.\n Note that each of the scenarios presented here can be played in isolation should you wish.\n\n\nRelated:\nLinked Battles\nFirst Linked Battle\nSecond Linked Battle\nThird Linked Battle"

    "Type": "General",
    "Description": "Description: The role a Games Master takes will vary from group to group. It may be a blend of all the points that follow or be something else entirely, as the players and their games require.\n # An Unbiased Observer\n The role of GM can be to simply observe the game and offer an impartial opinion on any uncertainties that arise. Players can share secrets with the GM, such as the predetermined point that reinforcements will arrive from, or where Scouts are deployed in hiding. With a GM's help, entire armies can even be deployed in secret.\n # A Narrator & Storyteller\n Some groups will be fortunate enough to include a member gifted in storytelling and the creation of unique scenarios. This can be utilised by allowing the individual, acting as GM, to set the scene and talk the players through the action as it unfolds. Should the game take an unexpected turn, a skilled GM can either alter the narrative to accommodate this, or gently nudge the action back onto the intended track.\n # An Arbiter of the Rules\n For many, the role of GM is of someone who forges and re-forges the rules throughout a game to maintain the flow of the action. When taken in conjunction with the telling of an unfolding story, this can result in many unusual events happening, creating some truly memorable moments.\n # An Impartial Third Player\n Imagine a group of skirmishers moving through a wood have disturbed the lair of a terrible beast, or the noise of a battle in an underground realm has awoken a slumbering Dragon. In such cases, these wandering monsters can be controlled by the GM. There may even be a third force involved in the game somehow, controlled by the GM.\n # Fate's Representative\n Sometimes, a battle might need nudging along in a certain direction, and if the game is part of a campaign, this might be especially important. In such cases, a GM might choose to help one of the players in small ways, or to hinder another. Ideally, this should only be done when the action requires it.\n The presence of a GM can add many extra levels to your games, and players are encouraged to give it a try – no one knows until they do just how much fun the role can be or who will be best at it.\n\n\nRelated: The Games Master"

    "Description": "Description: Another key aspect of open play is that it gives players permission to change a rule if doing so will improve the experience in the moment. For example, a vital unit might unexpectedly lose combat and Break, causing the game to end suddenly and unsatisfyingly. Of course, such is the way of things and there is no altering that. However, sometimes players encountering such an event might agree to alter the outcome of the Break test, perhaps allowing the defeated unit to instead Fall Back in Good Order. Doing so might extend the game and, more importantly, might feel like the more correct outcome in the circumstances.\n By way of another example, imagine a battle fought under the gloom of twilight. In such conditions, shooting may reasonably be expected to be less effective. To evoke this, players may add a rule, perhaps agreeing that all long range shooting suffers an additional -1 To Hit modifier, or perhaps agreeing that the Range characteristic of all missile weapons should be reduced.\n Whatever the case, players – especially good friends who know one another well – are encouraged to make amendments to the rules before or during a game if doing so will help to enforce the narrative. Provided both players are having fun and are in agreement, such amendments and alterations can lead to some truly memorable moments."

However, as even greater losses have now been suffered, they must roll a D6 for each unit that suffered casualties or was removed from play during the second battle:\n Units that Suffered Casualties:  For each unit that lost more than a quarter (25%) of its Unit Strength during the second battle, roll a D6:\n - On a roll of 1-2, remove:\n - D3 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 5) if the unit's Unit Strength is 19 or lower.\n - D6 models (to a minimum of Unit Strength 10) if the unit's Unit Strength is 20 or higher.\n - On a roll of 3+, the unit has managed to patch up its wounded and return them to battle.

    "Description": "Description: The term 'narrative battle' describes any battle that allows players to explore the background by adding new rules to the game or by foregoing rules that seem restrictive in the circumstances. Of course, there is nothing wrong with simply fighting a battle for the sake of it – the game is there to be enjoyed in all its forms, and it can be argued that any game has a degree of narrative behind it as almost all players will imagine the action unfolding in cinematic scope within their mind's eye. A narrative battle is one that expands upon this, drawing both players into a shared story.\n This can be done in a number of ways – by adding a story that sets the backdrop for the forthcoming battle, by adding scenario special rules or victory conditions (be they drawn from another scenario or source, or be they especially written by the players) that make the characters, armies or environment better evoke the story. In this way the battle itself completes the 'tale' begun by the scenario.\n\n\nRelated: Historical Recreations, Custom Scenarios, Narrative Scenarios"

Roll on the Miscast table.\n\n *Dispelling A Spell*\n When your opponent casts a spell, you can make a dispel attempt. To dispel a spell, roll 2D6 (if attempting a Wizardly dispel, add the dispelling Wizard's level):\n - If the result is equal to or higher than the Casting roll, the spell is dispelled.*\n * Admin Note:  This has been flagged by the community as possibly erroneous due to the conflict with the rule:  Dispel Roll & Dispel Result\n - If a natural double 6, the spell is dispelled regardless of the casting result.\n - If a natural double 1 is rolled, the dispel attempt fails.

Centre a 5\" blast  template  over the Wizard. Every model (friend or foe) whose base lies underneath the template risks being hit and suffering a single Strength 10 hit with an  AP  of -4.|\n|5-6|Calamitous Detonation:  Roiling magic explodes from the Wizard in a flash of light.

Any that fail continue to flee.\n\n  # Movement Phase\n The Movement phase is broken up into several sub-phases:\n *1. Declare Charges & Charge Reactions*\n The active player declares charges, indicating which of their units are charging, and which enemy unit is being charged:\n - A charging unit must be able to draw a line of sight to the unit it wishes to charge.\n - Units that are in a Marching Column, engaged in combat or fleeing cannot charge.\n\n *Charge Reactions*\n When charged, a unit can declare one of several charge reactions:\n Hold: The unit stands its ground to receive the charge.\n Stand & Shoot:  The unit fires its missile weapons at the charging unit. If the distance between the units is less than the charging unit's Movement characteristic then this reaction cannot be declared.\n Flee: The unit flees directly away from the charging unit:\n - Pivot the unit about its centre so that it is facing directly away from the centre of the charging unit.\n - After pivoting the unit immediately makes a flee move.\n - If a unit is already fleeing it must declare this reaction (note that a unit cannot make more than one charge reaction in a phase).\n\n *2. Charge Moves*\n To complete a charge:\n Determine Charge Range:  Roll two D6 and discard the lowest, this is the Charge roll. Add the Charge roll to the unit's Movement characteristic, this is the charge range.\n \n Move Charging Unit:  If the charge range is sufficient to reach the target unit, perform a  charge move .\n Failed Charges:  If the charge distance isn't sufficient to reach the target unit, the charging unit moves directly towards the target a distance equal to the Charge roll.\n Charging a Fleeing Enemy:  When charging a fleeing enemy:\n - If the charging unit makes contact with the fleeing unit, it wheels to align and the fleeing unit is destroyed. The charging unit may take a Leadership test to attempt to reform.\n - If the charging unit does not make contact with the fleeing unit, it moves forward its full charge range.\n\n *3. Compulsory Moves*\n All compulsory moves are made during this sub-phase.\n *4. Remaining Moves*\n Any remaining units may move during this sub-phase. Wizards may cast Conveyance spells.\n Marching: A marching unit can move up to double its Movement characteristic (triple, if in a Marching Column) and may wheel to change direction, but cannot perform any other manoeuvres. If a unit wishes to march while within 8\" of an enemy unit, they must first pass a Leadership test.\n Manoeuvres: During its movement, a unit may perform one of the following manoeuvres (note that no model may move more than double its Movement characteristic):\n - Wheel: The leading edge of the unit moves forward, pivoting around one of its front corners.\n - Turn: All models remain in place and turn through 90° or 180° to face their side or rear. For every 90° it turns, a unit uses a quarter of its Movement characteristic.\n - Move Backwards:  The unit halves its Movement characteristic and moves backwards.\n - Move Sideways:  The unit halves its Movement characteristic and moves sideways.\n - Redress the Ranks:  The unit uses half of its Movement characteristic to add or remove up to five models to or from its front rank.\n - Reform: The unit uses its entire Movement characteristic to pivot about its centre to change its facing, and to rearrange itself as required to change formation or adopt a different formation.\n\n  # Shooting Phase\n The Shooting phase is broken down into several sub-phases and is followed in full for each shooting unit, one at a time:\n *1. Choose Unit & Declare Target*\n A unit is selected to shoot and its target is declared.\n *2. Roll To Hit*\n To determine if your models hit, roll To Hit using the below chart based on their Ballistic Skill:\n \n\n|||||||\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Ballistic Skill|1|2|3|4|5|\n|D6 roll To Hit|6+|5+|4+|3+|2+|\n\n \n One or more of the following modifiers may apply to your roll(s) To Hit:\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|Moving and  Shooting|-1|\n|Firing at Long Range|-1|\n|Standing and Shooting|-1|\n|Target Behind Partial Cover|-1|\n|Target Behind Full Cover|-2|\n\n \n *3. Roll To Wound & Make Armour Saves*\n Roll To Wound:  For each hit, make a roll To Wound, cross-referencing the weapon's Strength with the target's Toughness on the below chart:\n \n\n||||||||||||\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|A\\T|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|\n|1|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|-|-|\n|2|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|-|\n|3|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|\n|4|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|\n|5|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|\n|6|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|\n|7|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|\n|8|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|\n|9|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|\n|10|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|\n\n Armour & Ward Saves:  For each wound, your opponent can make an  Armour Save  roll.\n *4. Remove Casualties & Make Panic Tests*\n Remove Casualties:  Unsaved wounds are applied to the unit, each causing a model to lose one Wound. When a model has been reduced to zero Wounds, it is removed as a casualty.\n Make Panic Tests:  If, during the Shooting phase, a unit loses more than a quarter (25%) of the models it contained at the beginning of the Shooting phase, it makes a  Panic test .\n *Misfire Tables*\n If a 'Misfire' is rolled on an Artillery dice when firing a war machine, you may be required to roll on one of the following Misfire tables:\n *Stone Thrower Misfire Table*\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|D6|Result|\n|1|Destroyed: The weapon cannot take the strain! Bits of wood and metal debris are thrown into the air and the stone tumbles to the ground. The model is destroyed and immediately removed from play.|\n|2-4|Malfunction: One of the crew has become caught in the firing mechanism. This problem can be fixed, but only by partially dismantling the weapon, the crew member, or both. The crew immediately loses one Wound, the model fails to shoot this turn and cannot shoot before the end of the next round.|\n|5-6|Twang: Something has snapped. This is a rather minor mishap, but one that will require plenty of elbow grease and strong language to repair. The model fails to shoot this turn.|\n\n \n *Black Powder Misfire Table*\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|D6|Result|\n|1|Destroyed: The weapon explodes with a thunderous noise, leaving a hole in the ground and a cloud of black smoke hanging in the air. The model is destroyed and immediately removed from play.|\n|2-4|Malfunction: One of the crew has become caught in the firing mechanism. This problem can be fixed, but only by partially dismantling the weapon, the crew member, or both. The crew immediately loses one Wound, the model fails to shoot this turn and cannot shoot before the end of the next round.|\n|5-6|Pffft: The fuse has gone out. As far as mishaps go, it is not very serious, but one of the crew will be feeling rather foolish! The model fails to shoot this turn.|\n\n \n  # Combat Phase\n The Combat phase is broken up into several sub-phases.\n *1. Choose & Fight Combat*\n This sub-phase is broken down into the following steps:\n *1.1. Choose Combat & Determine Who Can Fight*\n The active player chooses which order the combats are resolved in. Each combat must be fully resolved before moving onto the next one. Each combat is resolved in Initiative order. Models in a charging unit gain a bonus to their Initiative for the remainder of the turn depending on how far they charged:\n - Charging an Enemy in their Front Arc : +1 Initiative per full 1\" moved, to a maximum of +3.\n - Charging an Enemy in their Flank or Rear Arc:  +1 Initiative per full 1\" moved, to a maximum of +4.\n\n Each model in the fighting rank can attack, though models that are not in base contact with the enemy unit may only make one attack regardless of the number of attacks on their profile.\n *1.2. Roll To Hit*\n Make a roll To Hit for each attacking model, cross-referencing their Weapon Skill with that of the model they are attacking:\n \n\n||||||||||||\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|A\\T|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|\n|1|4+|4+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|\n|2|3+|4+|4+|4+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|5+|\n|3|2+|3+|4+|4+|4+|4+|5+|5+|5+|5+|\n|4|2+|3+|3+|4+|4+|4+|4+|4+|5+|5+|\n|5|2+|2+|3+|3+|4+|4+|4+|4+|4+|4+|\n|6|2+|2+|3+|3+|3+|4+|4+|4+|4+|4+|\n|7|2+|2+|2+|3+|3+|3+|4+|4+|4+|4+|\n|8|2+|2+|2+|3+|3+|3+|3+|4+|4+|4+|\n|9|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|3+|3+|3+|4+|4+|\n|10|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|3+|3+|3+|3+|4+|\n\n *1.3. Roll To Wound & Make Armour Saves*\n For each hit, make a roll To Wound, crossreferencing the weapon's Strength with the target's Toughness on the below chart:\n \n\n||||||||||||\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|A\\T|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|\n|1|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|-|-|\n|2|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|-|\n|3|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|-|\n|4|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|-|\n|5|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|6+|\n|6|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|6+|\n|7|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|6+|\n|8|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|6+|\n|9|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|5+|\n|10|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|2+|3+|4+|\n\n For each wound, your opponent can make an  Armour Save  roll.\n *1.4. Remove Casualties*\n Casualties are removed from the rear rank of the unit as normal, representing members of the rear ranks stepping forward to fill gaps left by fallen comrades. A model cannot attack during a phase in which it  stepped forward .\n *2. Calculate Combat Result*\n To determine your combat result score, consult the table below and calculate how many 'combat result points' your unit(s) scored:\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|Unsaved wounds inflicted|1 point each|\n|Rank Bonus|+1 point/rank|\n|Standard|+1 point|\n|Battle Standard|+1 point|\n|Flank attack|+1 point|\n|Rear attack|+2 points|\n|High ground|+1 point|\n|Overkill|+1 point/excess wound|\n|Other bonuses|As applicable|\n\n \n *3. Break Test*\n Each unit belonging to the losing side must make a Break test by rolling 2D6 and applying the difference between the winner and the loser's combat result scores as a negative modifier. Compare the result to the unit's Leadership characteristic:\n - If the result of the natural roll is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit 'Breaks' and flees.\n - If the result of the natural roll is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, but the modified result is higher than the unit's Leadership, the unit Falls Back in Good Order.\n - If the modified result is equal to or lower than the unit's Leadership, or if the roll is a natural double 1, the unit Gives Ground.\n\n *4. Follow Up & Pursuit*\n Once Break tests have been made, but before any units Give Ground or make a Flee roll, the winning unit(s) must decide what they will do next: restrain and reform, follow up or pursue.\n Restrain & Reform:  A unit that wishes to restrain & reform makes a Restraint test by testing against its Leadership. If this test is passed, it remains where it is and may make a free reform. Otherwise, it must follow up or pursue.\n Follow Up:  If the enemy Gives Ground, the winning unit(s) move forwards to engage it once again. Before following up, a unit may perform a free turn manoeuvre (of 90° or 180°).\n Pursuit: If the enemy Falls Back in Good Order or flees, the winning unit(s) can  pursue .\n Overrun: If a unit wiped out its enemy, it may overrun by making a pursuit move directly forwards."

Yet the pantheon of daemonic beings is far greater than this. Within the Realm of Chaos there dwells an infinite number of creatures that owe no allegiance to the Ruinous Powers. Such creatures often manifest within the mortal realm, some masquerading as elemental sprites, mischievous spirits of house and hearth, others possessing a host and bending it to their will.\n In truth, denizens of the Old World think of Daemons rarely, fearful that doing so might summon them forth! In this superstitious belief, Daemonologists are not like others. Through rituals and invocations shared and perfected within secretive covens, they endeavour to summon forth the most powerful of Daemons, hoping to entrap them and bind them to their will. Some use props in their craft, binding daemonic servants into mundane items such as books, oil lamps, staffs, even weapons of war. Thus bound, a Daemon becomes subservient to the Wizard that summoned it and must comply with its master's wishes. Yet Daemons are ever dishonest, their words and deeds selfish and cruel. Consequently, most Daemonologists quickly fall foul of the very beings they believed they had mastered.\n For all their mysticism and ritual, their secret orders and wealth of arcane knowledge, Daemonologists are not the enlightened seekers of truth many believe themselves to be.

Twisted and warped by Chaos, the unseen strands of colour that composed pure magic merged and bled into one another, causing the Winds of Magic to grow blackened and ever more unstable.\n Amongst the Elves of Ulthuan, there were those drawn to this phenomenon. Sensing a raw source of power, magic which could be mastered more easily, they began to experiment with its use. Quickly, most learned the dangers – that magic corrupted by Chaos would quickly corrupt those that sought to master it – yet there were those that persisted.\n Today, Dark Magic still torments the world. Wherever the touch of Chaos is felt most strongly, the Winds of Magic twist and coalesce into dark, roiling clouds. Many Wizards feel compelled to study and use Dark Magic, wielding it with careless abandon, enraptured by its potency and the apparent ease of its mastery.

Other Elementalists prefer to turn their magical powers to a different, more scientific purpose, melding arcane knowledge of the yellow wind and study of natural philosophy within the halls of academia to study alchemy.\n In battle, the powers an Elementalist wields are a considerable blessing, able as they are to disrupt the enemy lines, entrench and defend their own, and even cause the weapons of allies to burn with the heat of their forging whilst the armour of their foes crumbles to rust.\n \nStorm Call\n - Flaming Sword\n - Plague of Rust\n - Summon Elemental Spirit\n - Earthen Ramparts\n - Wind Blast\n - Travel Mystical Pathway"

With mastery of each wind, the mage edges closer to understanding High Magic and, eventually, becomes able to draw all of the winds together, crafting High Magic.\n This may seem similar to the use of Dark Magic, similar even to the lesser Lores of Magic. It is not. Where other Wizards grasp clumsily at the Winds of Magic, or warp them into darker hues, High Mages carefully bring all eight winds together, seeking the silvery light of pure magic and crafting spells of such sublime potency that lesser Wizards are struck dumb to witness. A simple fireball cast by a Battle Mage may burn hot with the power of the red wind, but one conjured by a High Mage will burn incandescently bright, searing the world and blinding all that gaze upon it. Such is the power of High Magic.\n \nDrain Magic\n - Walk Between Worlds\n - Fiery Convocation\n - Tempest\n - Corporeal Unmaking\n - Fury of Khaine\n - Shield of Saphery"

As Orcs and Goblins rush into battle, the Waaagh! rises in great storms that spring forth to drown entire regions, before draining away once more, leaving only wisps of magical potential behind.\n An Orc or Goblin Shaman, blessed by Gork (or possibly Mork) can focus the Waaagh! through the power of their mind (such as it is), casting spells as brutal and cunning as Gork and Mork themselves. These shamans have been known to burst the skulls of their foes, to shoot beams of crackling green death from their beady eyes or to summon almighty green appendages from the skies to punch and kick the enemy.\n Yet with great power comes great peculiarity, and shamans are a most peculiar breed. Constant exposure to the raw Waaagh! and the will of their gods causes Orcs and Goblins to become somewhat unhinged. Consequently, their shamans are prone to drifting into trances, breaking uncontrollably into spasmodic dancing, and talking animatedly to unseen entities.

To make a Panic test, test against the unit's Leadership characteristic:\n - If this test is failed, the unit has succumbed to panic and must either Fall Back in Good Order or flee (see opposite).\n - If this test is passed, the unit remains resolute in the face of enemy fire and does not panic.\n\n What happens to a unit that fails a Panic test will depend upon how many casualties that unit has suffered. A unit that has suffered only a few casualties will retreat, but will quickly rally, whereas a unit that has suffered a significant amount of casualties will turn tail and flee.\n # Fall Back in Good Order\n If more than half (50%) of the models the unit contained at the start of the battle still remain, it will  Fall Back in Good Order .\n # Flee\n If only half (50%), or fewer than half, of the models the unit contained at the start of the battle still remain, it will immediately turn tail and  flee .\n\n\nRelated: No Need for Hysterics (Psychology)"

Therefore, you would need to roll a 7 to achieve the target number of 5+, which is not, strictly speaking, possible on a six-sided dice.\n In such cases, there is still a chance of hitting. Roll To Hit as normal. Each dice that rolls a natural 6 represents that chance of hitting and is rolled again, as shown below:\n \n\n|||\n|:--|:--|\n|D6 Roll Needed|Will Hit On A Natural 6…|\n|7|followed by a 4+|\n|8|followed by a 5+|\n|9|followed by a 6|\n|10|Impossible!|\n\n \n To continue the previous example, if a unit of models with BS2 suffered a -2 To Hit modifier, simply roll To Hit as normal.

Infantry forms the backbone of most armies and is split into four sub-categories:  Regular Infantry ,  Heavy Infantry , Monstrous Infantry and  Swarms .\n # Cavalry\n The term  cavalry  refers to any riders mounted on war beasts – commonly warhorses or similar creatures. It can also include war beasts on their own as packs of animals which will often function in a manner more similar to cavalry than infantry. Cavalry is split into four sub-categories:  Light Cavalry ,  Heavy Cavalry ,  Monstrous Cavalry  and  War Beasts .\n # Chariots\n A chariot  is usually a wheeled war vehicle drawn into battle by beasts of some kind and crewed by warriors, armed to the teeth. This category can also include large objects, such as mobile altars, that are pushed along or carried. Chariots are split into two sub-categories:  Light Chariots  and  Heavy Chariots .\n # Monsters\n  Monsters  are the largest beings in the Warhammer world, creatures so powerful that they usually roam the battlefield alone. In spite of this, due to their size they function as Close Order units, rather than as Skirmishers. This category includes Dragons, Gryphons and so on. Monsters are split into two sub-categories:  Monstrous Creatures  and  Behemoths .\n # War Machines\n  War machines  such as cannon and bolt throwers are powerful units on the field of battle, able to pulverise whole regiments, breach stone walls or even slay fearsome monsters with a single, well-placed shot. This is a broad category with varied rules that cover the many different weapons to be found in the Warhammer world, the most commonly seen of which are dealt with in their own  section ."

Instead, they will 'form up' into base contact with one another, edge-to-edge and front corner to front corner, against the enemy in order to create a fighting rank. Skirmishers that charge the enemy, or that are themselves charged by the enemy, must always form up in this way once contact is made. Any Skirmishers that cannot make base contact with the enemy cannot form part of the fighting rank and must instead form up into ranks behind the fighting rank.\n Skirmishers will maintain this close formation until the combat is over (i.e., until they are not engaged with any enemy at the end of a Combat phase), at which point they will once again adopt Skirmish formation.\n\n\nRelated: Skirmishers & Rank Bonus, Skirmishers & Disruption"

Accordingly, a war machine’s profile will give a base size for both the war machine and its crew. The benefit of basing a war machine’s crew separately is that, for each Wound the crew loses, you can remove one of the crew models as a reminder.\n During deployment, the models representing a war machine’s crew should be positioned adjacent to and in base contact with it. Once placed, the models must remain in position, adjacent to their war machine. Individual crew models should be ignored for the purposes of measurement or when determining line of sight.\n However, many players like to base their war machines and crew together on a single large base, making of their war machines small dioramas that show the crew hard at work.

This does not have to be an enemy model; it can be a point on the ground. Once you have chosen your target point, mark it with a small marker.\n2. Fire: Once the target point has been marked, roll an Artillery dice:\n    - If a 'Misfire' is rolled, something has gone horribly wrong. Roll immediately on the appropriate Misfire table to determine exactly what.\n    - If a number is rolled, move the target point marker that many inches, directly away from the cannon.

Bounce: Unless the cannon misfired, the cannonball will bounce from the strike point, tearing through anything in its path. To determine how far the cannonball bounces, roll another Artillery dice:\n    - If a 'Misfire' is rolled, the cannonball buries itself in the ground and comes to a rest.\n    - If a number is rolled, the cannonball bounces, as shown in Fig 226.1. Measure the distance of the bounce from the strike point, directly away from the cannon.\n4. Determine Hits: Once the strike point and the distance of the bounce have been established, it is time to determine which models (if any) have been hit:\n    - Any model whose base lies underneath the strike point is hit automatically.\n    - Any model whose base lies under the path of the bouncing cannonball is hit automatically.\nHowever, should a cannonball bounce through a formed unit, it can hit a maximum of:\n    - One model per rank, if the cannon lies in the unit’s front or rear arc.\n    - One model per file, if the cannon lies in the unit’s flank arc. Models that lie fully beyond the distance of the bounce are not hit.\n5. Crunch: Sometimes, a bouncing cannonball will encounter something that stops it dead:\n    - If the cannonball hits a model whose troop type is monstrous creature or behemoth , it stops immediately. No further models are hit.\n    - If the path of the cannonball meets a hill, impassable terrain, or a high linear obstacle, it stops immediately. No further models are hit."

An indirect shot does not require a line of sight to the target unit, but is otherwise treated as a normal shot.\n An indirect shot is not as accurate as one where the crew can see their target:\n - If an arrow is rolled on the Scatter dice, resolve the scatter as normal.\n - If a 'Hit!' is rolled on the Scatter dice, the shot does not land on target (as would normally be the case) but merely scatters less – how much less depends greatly on the skill of the crew.

With the exception of these special rules, detachments are completely separate and independent from their regimental unit (i.e., spells, magic items and special rules affecting the regimental unit do not affect its detachments unless specifically stated otherwise).\n\n\nRelated: Using Regiments & Detachments"

    "Description": "Description: Some battles are bitter affairs, fought between armies that offer no quarter and will expect no mercy. Where a pitched battle might end after several hours with both armies falling back, a battle fought until break point will rage on until one side is literally broken and destroyed, its scattered remnants cut down by pursuing enemies. Of the losing side, there is seldom little trace left come the morrow.\n This scenario represents a battle fought to the grim death – a battle not unlike a pitched battle, but one that will rage until one side is forced to concede.\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described.\n # Deployment\n Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the   alternating units  method.\n  # First Turn\n Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.\n # Game Length\n There is no turn limit for this scenario. Instead, the battle will last until one side reaches its 'break point' or until one side concedes.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n Break Point:  All armies have a breaking point. This is equal to a quarter (25%) of the total Unit Strength of the army at the start of the game. To calculate the break point of your army, simply add together the Unit Strength of every unit (including characters) in your muster list and divide the total by four, rounding fractions down.\n With each model removed from play as a casualty and with each unit destroyed, an army approaches its break point. If, during any Start of Turn sub-phase, the remaining Unit Strength of either army has fallen below its break point, that army is considered to have 'broken'. At this point, the game ends as models begin to flee, crumble into dust, dematerialise, and so forth.\n Note that units that have pursued a fleeing enemy off the battlefield and units held in reserve count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining whether or not an army has reached its break point.\n # Victory!\n If the game ends with one army having broken, the unbroken army achieves a crushing victory. Should both armies fall below their break point at the same time, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner.\n # Historical Recreation\n The Doom of Odo Todmeyer III took place deep within the Forest of Shadows. To represent this, you should endeavour to include as many woods as possible when setting up the battlefield. The battle was fought between the remnants of the Grand Army of Osterlund (an Empire army) and a much larger force of Beastmen. The Grand Army of Osterlund was led by Odo Todmeyer III, who should be represented by an Empire General mounted on a warhorse.\n The Beastmen far outnumbered the Grand Army of Osterlund. To reflect this, the Beastman player should have at least 25% more points to spend on their army than their opponent. However, much of this army emerged from the dark woods to entrap the Osterlunders. Therefore, at least half of all Beastman units with either the Ambushers or the Beastmen Ambush special rule should be held in reserve."

    "Description": "Description: The Old World is dotted with many important landmarks, be they watchtowers, arcane monoliths, grand mausoleums and more besides. Many battles are fought around such landmarks, and very often control of the feature is a great boon to an army, either in terms of morale, position, or something more ethereal.\n This scenario represents a battle fought for control of a special feature – a significant terrain feature at the centre of the table. This may be any  special feature .\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described. In addition, place a single  special feature  in the centre of the battlefield (players should agree which special feature to use from the terrain available).\n # Deployment\n Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies using the   alternating units  method.\n  # First Turn\n Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army first adds +1 to their roll.\n # Game Length\n Before the game begins, players can choose to play a 'fixed' length game or a 'random' length game:\n Fixed Game Length:  The battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.\n Random Game Length:  The battle will last a random number of rounds or until one side concedes. Starting at the end of the fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least one more round.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n This scenario has no special rules.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner. The player that controls the special feature at the end of the battle wins a bonus of 200 Victory Points (in addition to any bonus controlling the special feature may normally give).\n # Historical Recreation\n The battle of the Lonely Reaver's Point watchtower was by no means a grand affair. It was fought between lowly peasants, eking a meagre existence as fishermen along the hostile coastline of Bretonnia, and a ragtag warband of Goblin raiders, likely forced down from the Pale Sisters by Orc aggression. The armies used to recreate the battle, then, should be equally humble.\n The Bretonnian army should contain no knights of any type – only peasant soldiers. The Goblin army should contain no Orcs of any type – only Goblins. Beyond this, there are no restrictions, and including war machines and Wizards will only add to the chaotic fun and confusion.\n This should be a fun battle to recreate and, more than any other discussed in this section, players are encouraged to abandon army composition rules, and even points values, when recreating the Lonely Tower. The less constrained by such rules the players are, the more fun the game will be."

Such tactics are sound and, if all goes well, are likely to deliver a swift victory. But there are times when an equally cunning enemy has the same plan.\n This scenario represents a battle in which both armies have assigned a number of units the task of outflanking the enemy. As these flanking forces choose their angle of attack in secret, there is as equal a chance that they will deploy facing one another as there is that they will find the unprotected flank of the main enemy force.\n # Set-up\n  Place terrain  as described.\n # Deployment\n Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite. Prior to deployment, both players secretly divide their armies into two forces – the main force and the flanking force:\n - A flanking force must contain at least one non-character unit and can be worth up to 33% of the total points value of the army (for example, in a 2,000 points game, your flanking force may be worth up to 666 points).\n - A flanking force may include characters, but cannot include the General.\n\n Once flanking forces have been selected, each player secretly makes a note of which flank (left or right) theirs will be deployed upon. Then, starting with the player that won the roll-off, the players deploy their main forces within their central deployment zone, using the   alternating units  method.\n Finally, after both players have finished deploying their main forces, the players reveal where their flanking forces are to be deployed. Starting with the player that won the roll-off, the players deploy their flanking forces within their chosen 18\" flank zone, using the alternating units method.\n # First Turn\n Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes the first turn.\n # Game Length\n The battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached.\n # Scenario Special Rules\n Other than the special deployment rules already given, this scenario has no special rules.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner.\n # Historical Recreation\n The battle of Pine Crags took place within a rocky ravine deep in Athel Loren. To represent this, you should endeavour to include as many woods and areas of rocky terrain (be they difficult, dangerous or impassable) as possible when setting up the battlefield. The battle was fought between a rag-tag army of Dwarf treasure hunters and a (possibly larger) force of Wood Elves. The Dwarf army should contain very few elite troops (such as Hammerers, Ironbreakers or Irondrakes) and no war machines or Runesmiths. Due to their important role, it must contain a unit of Dwarf Rangers in reserve.\n The Wood Elves caught the Dwarf army largely by surprise as it marched through Athel Loren, cutting down trees. To represent this, the Wood Elf player will automatically take the first turn."

The winner of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or B), as shown on the map opposite.\n Before deploying their army, each player rolls a D6 for each unit, including each character and war machine, in their army.

When they arrive, reserves may enter the battlefield from any point on the long battlefield edge within their deployment zone, and move on using the rules for  reinforcements .\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner.\n # Historical Recreation\n The Drakwald Forest incident was a battle fought between two armies of the Empire from rival provinces towards the end of a civil war that had raged for a thousand years. The army of Reikland should include a Witch Hunter, representing the firebrand Dietrich Haslav, whose actions arguably sparked the incident. In addition, the Reikland army should include at least one unit of Greatswords to accompany its General, a captain representing Magda Rassel, and might also include one unit of Flagellants to represent the Witch Hunter's followers. The army of Talabecland should be led by a captain, representing the famed Leonard van Obelmann.\n Both armies should include plenty of State Troops, the better to represent two forces on patrol. Both armies may include war machines. Ideally, neither should include any knights (of any type) or Wizards as there is no suggestion any were present.\n Finally, to better capture the nature of the battle, units arriving as reserves that are arrayed in Close Order or Open Order formations should be deployed in Marching Columns."

The battlefield is long but narrow, making simple manoeuvres difficult and outflanking almost impossible.

As such, no units (including fleeing units or any arriving from reserve) can leave or enter the battlefield via either long edge unless they have the Ethereal or Fly special rule.\n # Victory!\n Once the battle has ended, use  Victory Points  to determine which player is the winner.\n # Historical Recreation\n The battle of Gisoreux Gap was a brutal affair fought between two elite and well-equipped armies (all that toll money had to go somewhere!). The Bretonnian army should contain a high number of units of Knights. Any units of Men-at-Arms might be given heavy armour to represent the wealth of their lord and their superior position as guards of an important trade route. The Empire army, being an army of Westerland, a province famed for its use of mercenaries, may include any number of units of Veteran State Troops, provided all have the Mercenaries special rule. To help reflect the bitter nature of the battle and the inability of troops to simply turn tail and flee, players may give up to half of their units the Stubborn special rule.\n Both armies should be led by a General mounted on a warhorse, representing Sir Desfleuve and Countess Bergbrech respectively. Historically, there is no evidence that the two fought single combat during the battle, but, as the battle was a matter of honour, players should spare no efforts to ensure a challenge is fought between their Generals."

To reflect this, each army should be led by an appropriate character acting as the General. Warboss Durgath may fight on foot or may be mounted on a boar. King Louen must be mounted on a warhorse.\n In addition, and to capture a measure of the size and splendour of the armies, a historical recreation should be played with armies of no less than 3,000 points.\n The bulk of Waaagh! Durgath famously broke formation early, displaying a proper Orcish desire to engage the enemy. However, this ill-disciplined charge into heavy bow fire caused the Orcs to lose much of their advantage and, eventually, the battle.

These are:\n # Pitched Battles\n The most straightforward type of game. Two (or more) players decide to play a game, agree a points value for their armies and select a pitched battle scenario to play. Pitched battles allow for wellbalanced armies to meet and determine a victor with the minimum amount of fuss.\n You will find six  pitched battle  scenarios. Each of these differs in terms of how armies are deployed and offers different objectives. By using these simple scenarios, you are assured a fun and balanced game that can be set up quickly and easily.\n # Campaign Battles\n Linking games together, either by following an unfolding narrative or simply to find the most successful general within a group, is a great way to experience Warhammer: the Old World. Campaign battles often require more preparation and commitment from the players, but the rewards are worth the effort.\n You will find simple rules and guidelines for linking your games together into a  campaign . Future supplements will present far more in-depth campaign rules, from simple ladder campaigns, to map based campaigns and even unfolding quests and campaigns of conquest in which armies battle to complete objectives and earn rewards.\n # Narrative Battles\n This is a very broad category, often also described as 'open play'. Each of the pitched battle scenarios includes rules for playing a historical recreation of a famous battle from the Warhammer world. These introduce the simplest form of narrative battle – one that recreates history. The challenge of such battles is to see if you could have led your forces to a different outcome than your imagined counterpart did in the history books of this fantasy realm.\n You will find guidance on taking your  narrative  games further. This includes suggestions for plots and objectives, as well as more explanation of the role a 'games master' can play and how their presence can enhance the experience for everyone involved."

This includes the weapon's characteristics and lists any special rules it has:\n \n\n||||||\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|name|range|strength|armourPiercing|specialRules|\n|Flail (Profile)|Combat|S+2|-2|Requires Two Hands|\n\n # Range (R)\n All weapons have a Range characteristic, telling you at what distance the weapon can be used:\n - If the weapon's Range is 'Combat', the weapon can only be used in combat, against enemies the wielder is engaged with.\n - If the weapon's Range is a number of inches, the weapon is a missile weapon, used to shoot at the enemy. The number given indicates the weapon's maximum range.\n - If the weapon has two Range characteristics, both shown as a number of inches, the first is its minimum range, the second its maximum. For example, a stone thrower has a Range of 12-60\", meaning it can only shoot at things which lie between 12\" and 60\" away. Anything less than 12\" away is too close.\n\n # Strength (S)\n The weapon's Strength is used when making rolls To Wound against the enemy. For missile weapons, this is shown as a simple numerical value. For combat weapons this may be shown as 'S', indicating that the Strength of the wielder is used, or as 'S' with a modifier (for example, 'S+2'), meaning the Strength of the wielder is used but with a modifier applied.\n # Armour Piercing (AP)\n This shows how good the weapon is at punching through armour. This is always a negative modifier, which is applied to the dice rolled when making an Armour Save roll.\n # Special Rules\n Many weapons confer a universal  special rule  to attacks made by their wielder.\n # Notes\n Some weapons have notes specifying when they can be used (such as during a turn in which the wielder charged), when their modifiers apply (such as only during the first round of combat), or what type of model can wield them (such as 'models whose troop type is 'cavalry' only'). In addition, some weapons have their own unique rules. Such notes and any unique rules are contained here."
